title: Open-source code for mooring analysis
---

Mathematical modeling and numerical analysis of mooring systems for offshore floating wind turbines, wave energy devices and current energy are topical area recently. To date, there are four fully open-source programs for mooring simulations:

1. [MAP++](http://map-plus-plus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
2. [MoorDyn](http://www.matt-hall.ca/moordyn.html)
3. [FEAMooring](https://github.com/old-NWTC/FEAMooring)
4. [openmoor](https://github.com/chen-lin/openmoor)

In addition, __moody__ has its API hosted at [Github](https://github.com/johannep/moodyAPI) along with tutorials and examples while the source code is yet not available.
