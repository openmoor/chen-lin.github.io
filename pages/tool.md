The following tools I have developed in my research can be found at [Github](http://github.com/chen-lin).

### openmoor

Openmoor is an open-source program for simulating mooring systems in offshore floating wind turbines and wave energy devices. Find the source code and examples [here](https://github.com/chen-lin/openmoor/).

Below is an example of using openmoor to simulate the motion of a mooring cable model subjected to forced motion at the top end.

### farx

Fractional-order AutoRegressive model with eXogenous variables (FARX) for building thermo-dynamics can achieve comparable accuracy as classical ARX models while with a largely reduced number of parameters. This largely reduces the identification cost in system identification, therefore facilitating the model-predictive control. Find the code and an example [here](https://github.com/chen-lin/farx/).
